    <h1>VR MALL</h1>
    <hr color="black">
    <p><b>
            A VR mall is a digital, immersive shopping environment that allows users to explore virtual storefronts and
            purchase products in a 3D, interactive space. Using a virtual reality headset, shoppers can navigate through
            a virtual mall, walk into digital stores, and interact with products in ways that simulate real-life
            shopping. Some VR malls offer unique features like trying on clothes virtually, inspecting gadgets in 3D, or
            even attending virtual events, providing an engaging and futuristic shopping experience that goes beyond
            traditional online shopping.
            <br><br>
            In a VR mall, retailers create digital versions of their physical stores, making it possible for customers
            to experience their products in a more interactive way than on a website. These virtual stores can showcase
            items in 3D, and users can get a better sense of size, texture, and design. The VR mall can also integrate
            social features, allowing friends to shop together or chat with other customers. While still in its early
            stages, this type of shopping offers convenience, novelty, and a glimpse into the future of retail, where
            shopping merges with immersive digital worlds.
